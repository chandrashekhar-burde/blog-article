# Blog Article Page

This project is a simple blog article page built using only HTML and CSS. It is designed to look like a news or magazine article, with a clear title, date, author name, headline, and readable paragraphs. The layout focuses on clean typography and proper spacing to make the content easy to read.

The page also includes small side sections for additional blog topics, such as health and sports. This project is useful for practicing text layout, content structure, and basic page styling without using JavaScript or external frameworks.
